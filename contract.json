  "description": "Attentionless is a collection of generative collages of CC0 images in the style of abstractionism. It is what it should be. A revolt against the determinism of the world. It's about the formalisation of the space of ideas that is the precursor to the observable world. The growing entropy of events foams at the junctions of the will of the subjects, adding up to a much more complex scene of everything.",
